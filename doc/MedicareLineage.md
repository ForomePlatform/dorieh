The dictionary and the data lineage graphs are generated using the 
[Dorieh Data Dictionary tool](members/domain_dictionary).
              
The general structure of the generated dictionary is:

```{embed} #domain-dictionary-output
```

The top level files are:

* [Data lineage diagram](lineage/medicare.dot.md)
* [Alphabetic list of all tables](lineage/table-list.md)
* [Alphabetic list of all columns in all tables](lineage/column-list.md)
